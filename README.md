# Fibonacci64 - M5 Atom Lite - DemoReel100 With Buttons

This repository is a demo Arduino sketch for driving a [Fibonacci64](https://www.evilgeniuslabs.org/fibonacci64) using an [M5 Atom Lite](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit?variant=32259605200986) ESP32 development board.

Newer versions of the Fibonacci64 have header pins holes for mounting an Atom Lite directly onto the back of the board, along with holes for two small 4.5mm x 4.5mm tactile push button switches. The buttons are wired to pins G19 and G23 on the Atom Lite.
